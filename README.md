# Deep Learning Models for Image Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating deep learning models for image classification. The main objective is to design and test various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images into predefined categories. The project involves the following key tasks:

- **Storytelling**: Setting the context for image classification and explaining the relevance of the task.
- **Data Presentation**: Presenting and describing the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- **Initial Data Analysis (IDA)**: Conducting preliminary analysis of the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Preprocessing**: Performing detailed analysis and preparing the data for training, including normalization and augmentation.
- **Creating Baselines**: Establishing baseline models to provide a point of comparison for more complex models.
- **Deep Learning Experiments**: Developing and experimenting with various deep learning architectures to enhance model performance.
- **Conclusions and Future Work**: Summarizing the findings and proposing directions for future improvements.

## Data Preparation
The data used in this project is sourced from the [SOURCE OF THE DATA (www.kaggle.com)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification). The dataset comprises labeled images suitable for training and evaluating deep learning models. Detailed preprocessing steps are described in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Models
This project evaluates several deep learning architectures, including:

- **SimpleCNN**: A straightforward convolutional neural network model.
